# Blackjack But With Questions
A GUI based game of Blackjack, but you have to answer a question to hit. I made this for a final project for my IB Higher Level Computer Science Year 1 class. I made this project in 2018, but unfortunately, I didn't know how to use git or GitHub at the time, which is why there's no commit history and I am actually adding it in 2019.

## Set Up
This project was made in the Eclipse IDE. To contribute this project you will have to download Eclipse for Java and download all the addons relating to Window Builder and Swing, which are what allow the GUI to work. Then, open the project in Eclipse. To run the project, go to "blackjack/Home.java" and run it. For those who want to contribute, all card images are kept in the "cards" folder. All game files are in the "blackjack" folder.

## Current Functionality
- [x] Fully functional Blackjack engine
- [x] Functional GUI to play the game
- [x] File reading and writing for game files
